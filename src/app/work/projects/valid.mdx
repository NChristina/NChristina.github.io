# Visual Analytics in Data-Driven Journalism

**Project Homepage:** [https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/valid-visual-analytics-in-data-driven-journalism](https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/valid-visual-analytics-in-data-driven-journalism)

Like many other organizations, publishing houses and the news industry are facing tremendous challenges in making sense of the ever-growing amount of information. 
The goal of this project is to substantially improve Visual Analytics (VA) technologies to support the investigation of complex and heterogeneous data sources in Data-Driven Journalism (DDJ). 
Specifically, the project aims to address three key gaps identified in current DDJ practice: 
the usage gap (creating more user-friendly systems), the technology gap (enabling the analysis of complex, heterogeneous data), 
and the workflow gap (integrating DDJ more effectively into daily newsroom routines). 
The research focused particularly on time-oriented text data and time-oriented network data.

### The Challenge
Although DDJ has received attention from different communities and has found its way into a number of well-known 
news organizations such as the New York Times and the Guardian, the majority of journalists still face significant obstacles 
inhibiting the utilization of data for their work. 


### My Role & Responsibilities
- Conceputal design of a visualization dashboard 
- Coordination, conceptualization, writing, presenting scientific results at conferences
- Conducting user research, usability testing, interviews, workshops
- Preparing and conducting of empowerment workshop series for journalists

### Approach & Strategy
**Proof-of-Concept Prototype - Netflower:**
Journalists often need to explore how actors (nodes) and their connections (edges) evolve over time, 
including quantitative flows such as money, migration, or transfers between entities. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype netflower (dynamic network flow explorer) to support data journalists in their analysis tasks.
Over four years, we collaborated closely with journalists to understand their needs and iteratively design and evaluate the netflower tool. 
Using interviews and design workshops suited to their time constraints, we developed a solution combining (i) Sankey diagrams for intuitive visualization of weighted dynamic graphs, 
(ii) analysis workflows tailored to journalistic tasks, and (iii) onboarding features for quick adoption.

In detail, the visual exploration tool netflower supports journalists in investigating quantitative flows in dynamic network data for story-finding. 
The example above shows the media transparency dataset which tracks quarterly money flows between government institutions and media outlets. 
The main visualization is a Sankey diagram (a) showing the flows between legal entities and media institutions. Bar chart sparklines on both sides 
(b) give a temporal overview of outgoing (source nodes) and incoming money (target nodes). 
To load more data than visible at a first glance the show more and show less buttons (g) can be used. 
An on-demand bar chart (h) is provided to see the temporal evolution of one particular flow. 
ags can be assigned to the nodes on both sides (i) and then filtered for. Below the header area (c), 
netflower provides functionality for filtering, sorting and ordering (d, e). 
Moreover, a notebook is integrated into a sidebar (f) for investigative provenance.

**Empowerment Workshop Series:**
A data journalism workshop series was organized, prepared and implemented. 
During these workshops, we gave a short overview of the tools and working practices of data journalists. 
Katrin Nussmayr, an Austrian data journalist from newspaper “Die Presse” acted as a role model and was the lead mentor 
of our workshops. 

In total we organized the following workshops:					
Workshop 1 (FH JOANNEUM, Graz) – pilot test: 
Workshop 1 acted as a pilot test of the study and was conducted with eight journalism students (4 male, 4 female). 
					
Workshop 2 (Club Alpha, Vienna): 
In the second workshop eight (female) people participated, and again three of them used the netflower prototype v1. 
The participants worked in public relations (PR), journalism, and PR consulting fields. 

Workshop 3 (OÖ Presseclub, Linz): In total, eleven persons participated in the third workshop and six (3 male, 3 female) 
of them in our study for netflower (managing editor, journalists, consultant in the field of digital marketing, business consultant). 

Workshop 4 (ORF NÖ, St. Pölten): In the last workshop, three journalists (1 female, 2 male) participated and 
all of them tested netflower. Here, we adapted the workshop concept towards a more practical workshop, 
with only a short introduction session to DDJ. 
The aim of this workshop was to gain feedback on the final version of netflower, and to identify new datasets 
and use cases for dynamic network data. We deemed the latter important, so we can learn about the transferability of 
netflower to other journalistic questions, pinpointing netflower’s value beyond the datasets we focused on. 

In addition, a special workshop was held at the Journalistinnenkongress in Vienna (2017), 
focsussing on women journalists and media women as well a workshop for ORF scholarship holders in a trainee program of Jouranlismusverein St. Pölten (2018).

**Booklet:**
In the final project phase, our focus was on synthesizing insights from the problem analysis — including findings from literature reviews, interviews with newsroom and data journalists, and results from empowerment workshops — into practical, application-oriented guidelines and best practices. 
These materials serve as an accessible entry point for integrating data journalism practices into newsroom routines.
The outcomes were compiled into a booklet, available both in print and online via a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VALIDproject/ddj-booklet/wiki)
, enabling continuous contributions and updates by journalists and researchers alike. 
The booklet has also been introduced into teaching, first used in the summer term 2019 at FH JOANNEUM – University of Applied Sciences to familiarize journalism students with the fundamentals of data-driven reporting.


### Key Complexities Addressed
- Challenge 1: Visualization of heterogeneous dynamic network data
- Challenge 2: Providing a snapshot feature of the visual exploration session as a basis for discussions in the newsroom
- Challenge 3: Provide Guidelines and best practices for getting started with visual data exploration of dynamic network data
