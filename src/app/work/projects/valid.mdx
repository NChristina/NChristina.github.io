# Visual Analytics in Data-Driven Journalism

**Project Homepage:** [https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/valid-visual-analytics-in-data-driven-journalism](https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/valid-visual-analytics-in-data-driven-journalism)

**Data journalists** struggle with **information overload** and lack tools to analyze **complex temporal** data within tight deadlines. We designed **user-friendly Visual Analytics** systems that enable journalists to investigate **time-oriented network data**, seamlessly integrating these tools into their daily newsroom workflows.

### The Challenge
Although DDJ has received attention from different communities and has found its way into a number of well-known 
news organizations such as the New York Times and the Guardian, the majority of journalists still face significant obstacles 
inhibiting the utilization of data for their work. 


### My Role & Responsibilities
- Conceputal design of a visualization dashboard 
- Coordination, conceptualization, writing, presenting scientific results at conferences
- Conducting user research, usability testing, interviews, workshops
- Preparing and conducting of empowerment workshop series for journalists

### Approach & Strategy
**Proof-of-Concept Prototype - Netflower:**
Collaborated with data journalists over four years to design netflower, a tool for exploring temporal network flows (money, migration, transfers). Used interviews and rapid design workshops suited to newsroom pace. Iteratively developed intuitive Sankey-based visualizations, journalist-specific workflows, and onboarding features—enabling reporters to find stories in complex network data without extensive training.

Key Features are: 
- **Intuitive flow visualization** using Sankey diagrams for complex network relationships
- **Temporal context** through sparkline overviews of flow patterns
- **Information management** via progressive disclosure (show more/less)
- **Flexible exploration** with tagging, filtering, and sorting capabilities
- **Workflow integration** through investigative notebook for documentation and provenance


**Empowerment Workshop Series:**
Conducted **field research** with 30+ journalists, PR professionals, and students through workshop-based **usability studies** across four Austrian cities (Graz, Vienna, Linz, St. Pölten).
Partnered with industry expert Katrin Nussmayr (Die Presse) to ensure authentic scenarios. Iteratively evolved methodology from structured usability testing to hands-on application sessions, refining netflower based on real-world feedback and validating its adaptability to diverse journalistic workflows.

**Booklet:**
Translated research findings into actionable guidelines for newsroom adoption. Created an accessible booklet—available in print and as an open [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VALIDproject/ddj-booklet/wiki)- enabling collaborative updates and ensuring practical relevance. The resource is now used in journalism education programs.

### Key Complexities Addressed
- Visualization of heterogeneous dynamic network data
- Providing a snapshot feature of the visual exploration session as a basis for discussions in the newsroom
- Provide Guidelines and best practices for getting started with visual data exploration of dynamic network data
