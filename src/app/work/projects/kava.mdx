# Josef Ressel Center for Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics for Industrial Manufacturing Data

**Project Homepage:** [https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/josef-ressel-center-industrial-data-lab](https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/josef-ressel-center-industrial-data-lab)

The central concept of this research center is to use the specialist knowledge of experts through externalization and to integrate this explicit knowledge into the data analysis process for industrial production.

### The Challenge
Turning data into knowledge is a complex endeavor. While algorithms can reveal patterns, they often fail to distinguish meaningful insights from noise. Human expertise remains essential for interpretation—but the overwhelming volume of data can limit comprehension. Visual Analytics bridges this gap by combining automated analysis with interactive visualizations, enabling analysts to explore data, uncover hidden patterns, and make informed discoveries more effectively.

### My Role & Responsibilities
- Deputy Head of the JRC including academic leadership, managing daily operations,overseeing staff, ensuring implementation of strategic goals
- Work package lead for "Visualization Design" & coordination of three projects over three company partners
- Conceputal design of KAVA methods and visual analytics dashboards
- Coordination, conceptualization, writing, presenting scientific results at conferences
- Conducting user research, usability testing, interviews
- Lateral leadership of five team members
- Preparing and conducting co-design workshops with stakeholders (company partners)

### Approach & Strategy

**Design of Machine Activity Visualization Dashboard for Shopfloor Management:**
Starting from March 2025, we closely collaborated with our company partner to design and 
develop a near-real-time shopfloor board visualization for their factory building. The main aim of this 
project is to support machine operators and area managers in detecting and addressing machine 
downtimes. To explore how we can design and develop a shopfloor board visualization to support the target group 
in identifying machine downtimes, we applied a user-centered design process involving semi-structured 
interviews, low-fidelity prototypes, focus group evaluations, cognitive walkthroughs, a usability study 
with domain experts, a field study, and the implementation of the proof-of-concept prototype. The 
resulting shopfloor board visualization uses a card-based design that presents 
throughput, order prioritization, and machine performance, effectively supporting operators and 
managers in detecting and addressing machine downtimes.

The results of this research activity will be published at the VINCI Conference 
2025: Felbermayer, A., **Stoiber, C.**, & Wagner, M. (2025). Design of a Machine Activity Visualisation 
Dashboard for Shopfloor Management. Vinci’25 - Full Paper. The 18th International Symposium on 
Visual Information Communication and Interaction, Linz, Austria


**VAILO: A Visual Analytics Dashboard for Identifying Tied-up Capital in Manufacturing:**
VAILO (Visual Analytics for Inventory & Logistics Operations), a visual analytics dashboard designed to help manufacturing companies 
identify tied-up working capital caused by long lead times in supply chains. Developed in close 
collaboration with industry partners, the tool combines interactive treemaps and throughput diagrams to 
reveal inefficiencies in material flows and order fulfillment. Initial evaluations highlight their potential to 
support decision-making. 

Our methodology included (i) co-design workshops with industry experts, (ii) a usability study with manufacturing-savvy students, and (iii) a usage scenario with real company data. 

The results of this research activity will be published at the VINCI Conference 
2025. Größbacher, S., **Stoiber, C.**, Kainzbauer, L., Grassinger, F., Rotter, S., Felberbauer, T., & Wagner, M.

### Key Complexities Addressed
- Challenge 1: manufacturing companies to make sense of their data by identifying tied-up capital caused by long lead times in supply chains.
- Challenge 2: Support area managers and machine operators to detect unknown downtime events in real time
- Challenge 3: Designing visual analytics dashboards to reduce complexity, decrease cogntive load, support them in informed descisions

### Outcomes & Impact
- VAILO proof-of-concept prototype for identifying tied-up capital in manufacturing
- Proof-of-concept prototype for shopfloor Management to identify and react on unknown downtime events in the production

**Technologies/Methods:** Figma, D3.js, Angular.js, Sketch, User-centered design
