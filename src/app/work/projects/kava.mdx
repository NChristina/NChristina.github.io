# Josef Ressel Center for Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics for Industrial Manufacturing Data

**Project Homepage:** [https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/josef-ressel-center-industrial-data-lab](https://research.fhstp.ac.at/en/projects/josef-ressel-center-industrial-data-lab)

The central concept of this research center is to use the specialist knowledge of experts through externalization and to integrate this explicit knowledge into the data analysis process for industrial production.

### The Challenge
Turning data into knowledge is a complex endeavor. While algorithms can reveal patterns, they often fail to distinguish meaningful insights from noise. Human expertise remains essential for interpretation—but the overwhelming volume of data can limit comprehension. Visual Analytics bridges this gap by combining automated analysis with interactive visualizations, enabling analysts to explore data, uncover hidden patterns, and make informed discoveries more effectively.

### My Role & Responsibilities
- Deputy Head of the JRC including academic leadership, managing daily operations,overseeing staff, ensuring implementation of strategic goals
- Work package lead for "Visualization Design" & coordination of three projects over three company partners
- Conceputal design of KAVA methods and visual analytics dashboards
- Coordination, conceptualization, writing, presenting scientific results at conferences
- Conducting user research, usability testing, interviews
- Lateral leadership of five team members
- Preparing and conducting co-design workshops with stakeholders (company partners)

### Approach & Strategy

**Design of Machine Activity Visualization Dashboard for Shopfloor Management:**
Designed real-time shopfloor visualization dashboard for manufacturing partner to help operators and managers identify machine downtimes. Used iterative user-centered design—interviews, prototyping, usability testing, and field studies—resulting in a card-based interface displaying throughput, prioritization, and performance metrics.

**VAILO: A Visual Analytics Dashboard for Identifying Tied-up Capital in Manufacturing:**
Designed VAILO, a visual analytics dashboard helping manufacturers identify tied-up working capital from supply chain delays. Co-designed with industry partners, combining interactive treemaps and throughput diagrams to reveal material flow inefficiencies. Validated through co-design workshops, usability testing with manufacturing students, and real-world usage scenarios with company data.

### Key Complexities Addressed
- Manufacturing companies to make sense of their data by identifying tied-up capital caused by long lead times in supply chains.
- Support area managers and machine operators to detect unknown downtime events in real time
- Designing visual analytics dashboards to reduce complexity, decrease cogntive load, support them in informed descisions

### Outcomes & Impact
- VAILO proof-of-concept prototype for identifying tied-up capital in manufacturing
- Proof-of-concept prototype for shopfloor Management to identify and react on unknown downtime events in the production

**Technologies/Methods:** Figma, D3.js, Angular.js, Sketch, User-centered design
