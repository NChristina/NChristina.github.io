# Supporting students in learning how to read, understand, and construct data visualizations.

**Project Homepage:** [https://vis4schools.fhstp.ac.at/en](https://vis4schools.fhstp.ac.at/en)

The goal of this research project is to explore how digital learning materials need to be designed and which pedagogical methods are best-suited to 
raise the level of visualization literacy (i.e., constructing and interpreting data-visualizations) in school education. 
We tap into the power of visualization grammars, that formally describe the visual mapping and data transformation processes and enable a (semi-)automated creation of learning materials.

### The Challenge
The amount and complexity of data have grown tremendously in the last decades. Consequently, tools to support people in handling the enormous amounts of data are in urgently needed. One way to accomplish this is using visualizations. 
They take advantage of the powerful human perceptual system, which is adept at spotting patterns in visual input and making sense of it.
Visualization transforms data into graphical representations, yet these processes must remain transparent so users can interpret and trust them. Despite being naturally visual, most people lack formal training in reading or creating visualizations, 
making data comprehension difficult. This gap in visualization literacy poses a major challenge in helping users correctly interpret visual data and draw meaningful conclusions.


### My Role & Responsibilities
- Content-related team leadership including overseeing four workpackages (Analysis & Requirements, User-centered Design, Proof-of-Concept Prototype, Evaluation)
- Preparation & conducting of usability evaluations in schools and interviews with teachers
- Coordination of the design of learning materials (text book, video, ipad serious game, and playful comic ipad game)
- Coordination, conceptualization, writing, presenting scientific results at conferences


### Approach & Strategy
We use a combination of well-established qualitative and quantitative methods based on a user-centred design cycle. 
The target group are students from the age of 14 up to 19. A central element of the project are co-creation workshops, 
in which the target group is actively involved – specifically in the analysis and requirements process as well as in the design and evaluation steps. 
For teaching we employ learning materials based on videos and animations, educational games, textual descriptions with graphics, and visualization technologies (i.e., visualization grammars). 
The resulting technical framework and guidelines for the design and integration of learning materials on data visualizations will be made available for education institutions and teachers.


### Key Complexities Addressed
- Challenge 1: The need for transparency in visualization processes so users can accurately interpret and reconstruct visual representations.
- Challenge 2: A lack of visualization literacy, as users often have not been systematically trained to create, read, and interpret visualizations.
- Challenge 3: The educational gap—unlike reading or writing text, learning to interpret data visuals is rarely part of formal education, leaving most users ill-equipped to understand underlying data structures and patterns.
