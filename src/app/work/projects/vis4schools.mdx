# Supporting students in learning how to read, understand, and construct data visualizations

**Project Homepage:** [https://vis4schools.fhstp.ac.at/en](https://vis4schools.fhstp.ac.at/en)

Exploring how to **design digital learning materials** and **pedagogical methods** that improve students' ability to **create and interpret data visualizations**.

**Role:** Post-Doctoral researcher & content-related team lead | **Timeline:** 2022 - 2026 | **Type:** FWF WEAVE

### The Challenge
Data complexity is growing faster than people's ability to understand it. While visualizations can make data accessible by leveraging visual perception, most users lack the skills to interpret them correctly. This literacy gap prevents people from drawing accurate conclusions and trusting data-driven insights.


### My Role & Responsibilities
- Content-related team lead including overseeing four workpackages (Analysis & Requirements, User-centered Design, Proof-of-Concept Prototype, Evaluation)
- Preparation & conducting of usability evaluations in schools and interviews with teachers
- Coordination of the design of learning materials (text book, video, ipad serious game, and playful comic ipad game)
- Coordination, conceptualization, writing, presenting scientific results at conferences


### Approach & Strategy
Applied **user-centered design methods** through **co-creation workshops** with students aged 14-19, engaging them in every phase: research and requirements, design iterations, and evaluation. Designed **multi-format learning materials** - videos, serious games, explanatory comics, text book to support varied learning styles.


### Key Complexities Addressed
- The need for transparency in visualization processes so users can accurately interpret and construct visual representations.
- A lack of visualization literacy, as users often have not been systematically trained to create, read, and interpret visualizations.
- The educational gap—unlike reading or writing text, learning to interpret data visuals is rarely part of formal education, leaving most users ill-equipped to understand underlying data structures and patterns.
